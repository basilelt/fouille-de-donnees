## Time Series

Key Takeaways:
- Time series are temporally ordered datasets found in various fields like healthcare, finance, and engineering.
- Key properties include temporal dependency, seasonality, and trends.

Types of Time Series:
- Univariate: Single variable over time (e.g., stock prices).
- Multivariate: Multiple variables with dependencies (e.g., weather data).

Techniques Discussed:
- Decomposition into components (trend, seasonality, cyclic patterns, noise).
- Statistical features (mean, standard deviation, Z-normalization).
- Models: AR, MA, Fourier Transform, KNN, DTW, etc.
- Imputation methods for missing data.
- Dimensionality reduction (PAA, SAX).


What is the key property of time series data?
Temporal order matters


What does Z-Normalization do to a time series?
Standardizes the series to mean 0 and standard deviation 1


What is the primary goal of time series forecasting?
Predict future values based on past data


Which technique aligns time series of unequal lengths?
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)


What component of time series represents long-term progression or direction?
Trend


Which imputation method fills missing values by using the last observed value?
Forward Fill


What is the purpose of the Fourier Transform in time series?
Decomposes the series into frequency components


Which method is best for capturing cyclic patterns in time series?
Fourier Transform


Which method is used for filling missing time series data by replacing each missing value with the median of the observed values?
Forward Fill


What is the key advantage of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in time series classification?
It handles temporal distortions


What statistical feature captures the spread or dispersion of a time series?
Variance


Which model is often used to predict the future value based on the weighted sum of past values in time series analysis?
Auto Regressive (AR) model
