## Hierarchical Clustering

Advantages
- Easy to understand
- Allows easy variation in the number of clusters
- Intuitive visualization

Disadvantages
- Computational cost of the distance matrix
- The clustering criterion depends on the groups already formed
- Different results depending on the clustering criterion


What is the primary goal of clustering?
Divide a set of objects into groups


What type of task is clustering considered?
Unsupervised


Which distance measure is commonly used for numerical values in clustering?
Euclidean distance


What is the purpose of scaling attributes in clustering?
To ensure each attribute contributes equally


What does a dendrogram represent in hierarchical clustering?
Hierarchical representation of successive merges


Which linkage method is sensitive to noise in hierarchical clustering?
Single linkage


What is the main advantage of Ward’s linkage method?
Creates balanced clusters


How do you determine the number of clusters in hierarchical clustering?
Cut the tree at a specific height


What type of evaluation criterion is the Silhouette Coefficient?
Internal


What does the Adjusted Rand Index compare?
Clustering results to true labels


What is a major disadvantage of hierarchical clustering?
Computational cost of the distance matrix


In hierarchical clustering, how are clusters formed initially?
Each object is its own cluster


What is the centroid linkage method known for?
Good resistance to noise


What happens to the number of clusters during the hierarchical clustering process?
Decreases over time


Which criterion is based on inertia in hierarchical clustering?
Ward's linkage
